This repository contains the files of WebEdit (view more on [script4all.com/webedit](https://script4all.com/webedit).

I made the whole files on my own and without any team or library.

WebEdit is a online file management and editing system for developers. They can create their own website code online on their own webspaces. - WebEdit is no website configurator, thus it has not its disadvantages. Complete freedom.

### Setup
- Simply unzip WebEdit and move `/webedit` to a website's directory of your choice. You can also rename `/webedit` - WebEdit is doing the rest.
- Login very quickly with username `admin` and password `pass` and change your authentication data.
